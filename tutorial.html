					<h3>How to View Payments</h3>

					<p>The Partner rePortal contains multiple dashboards designed for specific reporting needs. Dashboard navigation can be found across the top of the page.</p>

					<img src="https://go.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/l/125771/2020-09-21/7f15jl/125771/141971/01_how_to_view_payments.png" alt="How to view payments" width="750" height="90" class="lg-bot-margin">
					
					<h4>Payment Overview Dashboard</h4>

					<p>The total payment is broken down by product and affiliate code and is summarized at the top of the Payment Overview dashboard. Note&colon; Payments are dispersed around the 22nd of the month following activity. For example, March activity is paid on approximately April 22nd.</p>

					<img src="https://go.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/l/125771/2020-09-21/7f15jq/125771/141975/02_payment_overview_dashboard.png" alt="Payment overview dashboard" width="864" height="408" class="lg-bot-margin">

					<p>Graphs are available for visual representation on this dashboard. One graph shows the number of merchants and the payment amounts over time. Another shows the payment amount per state.</p>

					<img src="https://go.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/l/125771/2020-09-21/7f15js/125771/141977/03_number_of_merchant_payments.png" alt="Number of merchant payments" width="864" height="395" class="lg-bot-margin">

					<img src="https://go.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/l/125771/2020-09-21/7f15jv/125771/141979/04_payments_by_state.png" alt="Payments by state" width="864" height="516" class="lg-bot-margin">

					<h4>Payment Details</h4>

					<p>The Payment Details tab shows the breakdown of each of your payments by merchant and provides details on how each payment was calculated.</p>

					<img src="https://go.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/l/125771/2020-09-21/7f15jx/125771/141981/05_payment_details.png" alt="Payment details" width="864" height="450" class="lg-bot-margin">

					<p>Click on a specific merchant or payment amount for additional details.</p>

					<img src="https://go.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/l/125771/2020-09-21/7f15jz/125771/141983/06_payment_details_focus.png" alt="Payment details focus" width="864" height="430" class="lg-bot-margin">

					<p>Please note&colon;</p>

					<p>The Payment Details report reflects only those merchants that generated a payment for that time period. If a merchant is missing from the report, there may not have been enough activity to generate a payment during that time period. All merchants can be found on the Portfolio Details dashboard, regardless of payment amount.</p>

					<h4>Portfolio Details</h4>

					<p>The Portfolio Details tab displays the lifetime payments summary information as well as the total number of merchant installs for the portfolio.</p>

					<img src="https://go.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/l/125771/2020-09-21/7f15k2/125771/141985/07_portfolio_details.png" alt="Portfolio details" alt="Portfolio details" width="864" height="552" class="lg-bot-margin">

					<p>The Merchant Details report displays a list of all merchants and their total lifetime payment. Click on the payment total for historical details.</p>

					<img src="https://go.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/l/125771/2020-09-21/7f15k4/125771/141987/08_merchant_details_focus.png" alt="Merchant details" width="864" height="420" class="lg-bot-margin">

					<h4>Filters</h4>

					<h3>How to Submit&sol;Track Referrals</h3>

					<h4>Lead Entry</h4>

					<p>To enter a lead, navigate to the Lead Entry tab.</p>

					<img src="https://go.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/l/125771/2020-09-21/7f15kq/125771/141997/12_lead_entry.png" alt="Lead entry" width="723" height="652" class="lg-bot-margin">

					<p>Fill out the top section entitled &ldquo;Your Information&rdquo; with your name and contact information.</p>

					<p>Under the &ldquo;Referral Details&rdquo; section, fill in the information of the business you are referring to Heartland. Don&rsquo;t forget to check the box that states that the business you are submitting has expressed interest and has agreed to be contacted by Heartland.</p>

					<p>Click the Submit button. Once submitted, the referral lead is automatically routed to your Relationship Manager and they will contact the business. You will be able to follow the activity of your lead in your Lead List found under the &ldquo;Lead Details&rdquo; tab.</p>

					<h4>Lead Details</h4>

					<p>The &ldquo;Lead Details&rdquo; tab displays your Lead List. It shows the date the lead was entered, the business name, status of the lead, the effective date of that status, the name of whom the lead was submitted by, what code it is attached to, and the Heartland Sales Person working the lead. It can be sorted by Lead Date, Status, Submitted By and Code.</p>

					<p>Please note&colon;</p>

					<p>Lead details are uploaded nightly. Once a lead is entered, it will appear on the lead details dashboard the next day. Any status changes to your leads will also be part of the nightly upload and will be viewable the next day.</p>

					<img src="https://go.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/l/125771/2020-09-21/7f15ks/125771/141999/13_lead_details.png" alt="Lead details" width="864" height="470" class="lg-bot-margin">
