					<h3>How to View Payments</h3>

					<p>The Partner rePortal contains multiple dashboards designed for specific reporting needs. Dashboard navigation can be found across the top of the page.</p>
					
					<h4>Payment Overview Dashboard</h4>

					<p>The total payment is broken down by product and affiliate code and is summarized at the top of the Payment Overview dashboard. Note&colon; Payments are dispersed around the 22nd of the month following activity. For example, March activity is paid on approximately April 22nd.</p>

					<img>

					<p>Graphs are available for visual representation on this dashboard. One graph shows the number of merchants and the payment amounts over time. Another shows the payment amount per state.</p>

					<img>

					<img>

					<h4>Payment Details</h4>

					<p>The Payment Details tab shows the breakdown of each of your payments by merchant and provides details on how each payment was calculated.</p>

					<img>

					<p>Click on a specific merchant or payment amount for additional details.</p>

					<img>

					<p>Please note&colon;</p>

					<p>The Payment Details report reflects only those merchants that generated a payment for that time period. If a merchant is missing from the report, there may not have been enough activity to generate a payment during that time period. All merchants can be found on the Portfolio Details dashboard, regardless of payment amount.</p>

					<h4>Portfolio Details</h4>

					<p>The Portfolio Details tab displays the lifetime payments summary information as well as the total number of merchant installs for the portfolio.</p>

					<img>

					<p>The Merchant Details report displays a list of all merchants and their total lifetime payment. Click on the payment total for historical details.</p>

					<img>

					<h4>Filters</h4>

					<p>Select from the filter options available on each dashboard. Click apply to activate the filter.</p>

					<img>

					<h4>Sorting</h4>

					<p>Reports are sortable by clicking the ascending&sol;descending arrows on a column header.</p>

					<img>

					<h4>Exporting</h4>

					<p>Place your cursor over the report and select the arrow next to the report title, then choose Download As and select your preferred file format.</p>

					<h3>How to Submit&sol;Track Referrals</h3>

					<h4>Lead Entry</h4>

					<p>To enter a lead, navigate to the Lead Entry tab.</p>

					<img>

					<p>Fill out the top section entitled &ldquo;Your Information&rdquo; with your name and contact information.</p>

					<p>Under the &ldquo;Referral Details&rdquo; section, fill in the information of the business you are referring to Heartland. Don&rsquo;t forget to check the box that states that the business you are submitting has expressed interest and has agreed to be contacted by Heartland.</p>

					<p>Click the Submit button. Once submitted, the referral lead is automatically routed to your Relationship Manager and they will contact the business. You will be able to follow the activity of your lead in your Lead List found under the &ldquo;Lead Details&rdquo; tab.</p>

					<h4>Lead Details</h4>

					<p>The &ldquo;Lead Details&rdquo; tab displays your Lead List. It shows the date the lead was entered, the business name, status of the lead, the effective date of that status, the name of whom the lead was submitted by, what code it is attached to, and the Heartland Sales Person working the lead. It can be sorted by Lead Date, Status, Submitted By and Code.</p>

					<p>Please note&colon;</p>

					<p>Lead details are uploaded nightly. Once a lead is entered, it will appear on the lead details dashboard the next day. Any status changes to your leads will also be part of the nightly upload and will be viewable the next day.</p>

					<img>

					<p>You can edit the Lead Date column to view a particular date or date range.</p>

					<img>

					<h4>Lead Status</h4>

					<p>Each lead will have one of the listed statuses below&colon;</p>

					<table class="xl-bot-margin">
					  <tr>
					    <th>rePortal Status</th>
					    <th>Definition</th>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
					    <td><b>Received</b></td>
					    <td>Your referral&sol;lead has been routed to your Heartland partner &lpar;RM or SPA&rpar; and is awaiting their acceptance.</td>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
					    <td><b>Contacting</b></td>
					    <td>Your referral&sol;lead has been accepted by your Heartland Partner (RM or SPA) and they are actively trying to reach the prospect.</td>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
					    <td><b>Appointment</b></td>
					    <td>Your Heartland partner (RM or SPA) has successfully reached the prospect and has scheduled an appointment to meet with the prospect. </td>

					    <td><b>Qualified</b></td>
					    <td>Your Heartland partner (RM or SPA) has qualified the prospect, entered initial numbers, and is creating a pricing model&sol;proposal for the prospect.</td>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
					    <td><b>InProgress&dash;Pricing</b></td>
					    <td>Your Heartland Relationship Manager has created a pricing model for presentation to the prospect (either waiting to present or actively negotiating).</td>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
					    <td><b>InProgress&dash;Contract</b></td>
					    <td>Your Heartland Relationship Manager is actively completing the merchant application.</td>
					  </tr>

					    <td>Merchant is actively processing with Heartland and has submitted their first &ldquo;batch&rdquo; of transactions for payment.</td>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
					    <td><b>Terminated</b></td>
					    <td>A shared customer has terminated their agreement with Heartland.  (Note&colon; the Status Date will not be updated with the date the account terminated, so terminated accounts will keep their &ldquo;Installed&rdquo; date as a final status date.)</td>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
					    <td><b>Lost</b></td>
					    <td>Your Heartland partner (RM or SPA) has determined this opportunity is no longer open for possible sale&sol;install.</td>
					  </tr>
