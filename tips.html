				    <li>If a batch is closed by 8 p.m. EST, funds are deposited the next morning.</li>
				    <li>There is only one deposit for all major card brands &mdash; including American Express and Discover &mdash; making it much easier to balance the books. Also, funds are received much faster than other processors.</li>
				    <li>Heartland does not charge &ldquo;junk fees&rdquo; or hidden fees. Customers know exactly what they are paying and why, because Heartland statements clearly define every charge.</li>
				    <li>Heartland does not arbitrarily increase pricing.</li>
				    <li>Heartland does not trap merchants with oppressive leases for aging equipment.</li>
				  </ul>

				  <p class="blue-box">Once your customer says they would like to know more, please send their contact information to your Heartland RM &lpar;Card&rpar; or SPA &lpar;Payroll&rpar;, using the <a href="https://reports.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/">rePortal</a>.</p>

					<h4>Referral Process Reminders</h4>

					<ul class="rsp-list">
				    <li>Speak with customers using the &ldquo;Conversation Starter&rdquo; talking points.</li>
				    <li>Speak to the value of Heartland. Price should not be mentioned other than to say Heartland provides clear and transparent pricing, and the customer will know exactly what they are paying and to whom.</li>
				    <li>Once the referral is entered into the rePortal, you can step back and let your Heartland partner take over the sales process from there! They will update you throughout the process and ask for assistance if needed.</li>
				    <li>Your Heartland RM&sol;SPA will have a pricing discussion with the customer. Please do not ask for a proposal or pricing comparison to give to the customer.</li>
				    <li>If you would like to attend the meeting with Heartland, be sure to let your RM&sol;SPA know, but always allow them to run the sales process. There are reasons for their methods.</li>
				    <li>Questions that are not in direct support of the sale should only be asked after the meeting and away from the customer.</li>
				    <li>Questions to your Heartland partners are welcome, but please remember that they are the merchant services&sol;payroll experts, and YOU are the expert at your own business.</li>
